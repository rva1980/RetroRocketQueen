# Astrea Rocket

Astrea Rocket is a 2D infinite horizontal scrolling game through a procedurally generated random world. Our protagonist has the mission of exploring as much terrain as possible, collecting valuable minerals and avoiding numerous dangers, with the only help of a helmet that will protect her from an impact and a rocket backpack that will allow her to fly while her fuel lasts.

All these mechanics result in fast and unique games in which the biggest challenge will be to beat your own score.

The parameters on which the scoring system is based are:

- The distance traveled.
- The duration time.
- The collected minerals.
- The excess fuel.

## Development

This is the first game I have made and it is being developed with Unity, while I am discovering and learning how to handle the development platform.

It has a pixelated graphic style with a resolution of 320 x 180 pixels and a black and white palette with 6 shades of gray.

The music has been made with the online tool BeepBox.
